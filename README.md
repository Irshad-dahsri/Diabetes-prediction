# Diabetes-prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project is about predicting the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on certain features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and others. The prediction is done using logistic regression, a machine learning algorithm that is used for binary classification problems.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from kaggle named as Diabetes Health Indicator - BRFSS. It contains 253680 observations and 22 features, with the target variable being whether or not a person has diabetes (0 for no diabetes, 1 for diabetes and 2 for diabetes).

Dependencies
This project is implemented in Python using the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
Files
The project contains the following files:

diabetes_012_health_indicators_BRFSS2015: The dataset used in the project
diabetes_prediction.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
README.md: This file
Running the code
To run the code, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. Once you have installed Jupyter, you can open the diabetes_prediction.ipynb notebook and run the cells one by one.

Results
The Random forest model achieved an accuracy of 88.5% on the test set. The confusion matrix was also plotted to evaluate the model's performance.
